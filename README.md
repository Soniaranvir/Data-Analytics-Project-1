Walmart Data Analysis Project

‚ú® Overview

Walmart is one of the world‚Äôs largest retailers, handling vast amounts of transactional data across multiple branches. This project focuses on analyzing Walmart‚Äôs sales data to uncover insights about customer behavior, sales trends, and business performance. By leveraging SQL, Python, and Tableau, we explored the dataset and created visualizations to drive actionable decisions.
